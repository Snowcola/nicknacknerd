What we discuss in this podcast:

* What is and isn’t AI is increasingly blurred
* My AI definition: fundamentally a computer that learns about its environment on its own
* Difference from an algorithm (e.g. tax software is “intelligent” but it’s just adding numbers). Story about contracting with company that thought they were AI.
* Where AI is really at: not machines taking over the world, it’s machines doing very specific jobs
* Cool stuff:

  * Audio

    * [Google magenta (new songs from dead composers)](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/)
    * [Frettable](https://www.frettable.com/)
  * Images/Video

    * [Deep Fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake)
    * Hot Dog no Hot Dog (Silicon Valley S4:E04)
    * [Google Deep Mind](https://deepmind.com/)
  * Text

    * Chat bots (Turing test)
    * Sentiment analysis (stock market)
    * Text creation, auto completion
    * Translators (shift from hand engineering to AI)
  * Video Games

    * Pathfinding
    * OpenAI, DOTA bots
  * Robots

    * [Boston dynamics dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNZPRsrwumQ)
    * Amazon warehouse robots
* AI vs ML vs RL
* ML: classification vs regression
* I’ve heard the word “training”. What the heck does that mean?
* Some big names in AI right now: Bengio, Hinton, Andrew Ng, Rich Sutton
